# Website Fingerprinting
This repository contains an extensible evaluation suite for Website Fingerprinting attacks, defenses,
and feature sets. As such, the project is heavily influenced by Giovanni Cherubins 2017 paper
["Bayes, not Na√Øve: Security Bounds on Website Fingerprinting Defenses"](https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/popets.2017.2017.issue-4/popets-2017-0046/popets-2017-0046.pdf),
with some API decisions taken from the researcher's code, which is available in 
[this repository](https://github.com/gchers/wfes).

However, this project aims at replacing the WEKA-based implementations of older attacks by something more modern (and
also more pythonic), such as [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for ML-related tasks and 
[`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data management and manipulation.
